# Meeting Notes


## Meeting with Matt and Sebastian October 12, 2018

There were some problems in CAFana due to changes in the Develop release - going back to a previously frozen version worked to resolved.

Next step is working on plots separating by truth level particles:
* Next week, Matt should learn how a CAF analysis works
* We should talk to Miranda about how to pull out truth-particle information.
